    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Maja blanca is a Filipino dessert with a gelatin-like consistency made primarily from coconut milk.
    Also known as coconut pudding, it is usually served during fiestas and during the holidays, especially Christmas.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh sweet corn kernels</li>
        <li>¼ cup sweetened flaked coconut</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Butter an 8-inch baking dish or pie pan and set aside.
        Mix together 1/2 cup water and cornstarch in a bowl until smooth; set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine the coconut milk, 3/4 cup water, and sugar in a saucepan over low heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved.
        Bring to a boil, add the corn kernels, and stir in the cornstarch mixture, stirring quickly to avoid lumps as it becomes very thick.
        Return to a boil and simmer until fully thickened and smooth, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes.
        Pour the maja blanca into the prepared dish and set aside to cool until firm, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Place the coconut flakes in a dry skillet over medium heat and stir to toast. Watch carefully so they don't burn.
        Remove the toasted coconut flakes to a bowl, let cool, and sprinkle over the pudding before serving.</li>
    </ol>
