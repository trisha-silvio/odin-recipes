    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Biko is a Filipino rice cake made of glutinous rice, also known as sweet or sticky rice.
    The rice is mixed with coconut milk and sugar, and then cooked to make a thick, dense cake.
    A sprinkling of latik, or golden-colored sprinkles made from coconut cream, gives it an added sweetness and a luscious flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 cups uncooked glutinous white rice</li>
        <li>6 cups cold water</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk, divided</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coconut preserves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Soak rice overnight in the water.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>Cook the soaked rice over medium heat in a saucepan with the soaking water, 1/2 can of coconut milk, and white sugar, stirring constantly, until tender and thickened, about 20 minutes.
        Pour into the prepared baking pan.</li>
        <li>Stir together the brown sugar, remaining 1/2 can of coconut milk, and coconut preserves in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil.
        Pour the mixture carefully over the rice.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the topping thickens, about 25 minutes. Cool completely; cut into squares to serve.</li>
    </ol>
